HaxBusterUrt plugin for Big Brother Bot (www.bigbrotherbot.net)
===============================================================

By Courgette


Description
-----------

This plugin helps detecting cheaters in Urban Terror game servers.
It does hax detection by checking GUID correctness. 

When such a bad guid is discovered, several actions take place :
 * if admins are playing, they get notified by private message
 * the cheater is given a notice, so it can be found in Echelon easily
 * a new B3 event is fired : b3.events.EVT_BAD_GUID so other plugins can act upon
 * if you choose so in the config file, the player is kicked

When an admin connects to the game, he is given a list of detected cheaters (if any)

 *  NOTE: some admin organisations / leagues do not recognize     *
 *  this method as a proof of hack !                              *
 *                                                                *
 *  For many, the only way to prove hacking is to take a demo     *
 *  of the suspected player.                                      *
 *                                                                *

 *  NOTE 2: Just a small percentage of hacking players do have    *
 *  such a corrupted GUID.                                        *
 *  Thus this plugin wont get rid of most hackers on your server. *
 *  At the time of writting, the best way to avoid cheaters is    *
 *  to enforce known cheaters banlists.                           *
