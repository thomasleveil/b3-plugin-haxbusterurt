To run the tests you need to specify where the location of the b3 module is.

You can to do by three different means :

1. add the b3 module location to the PYTHONPATH environment variable
2. add the b3 module location to the B3PATH environment variable
3. call the run.bat programme with the --b3path option

example :

run.bat --b3path c:\big-brother-bot\
